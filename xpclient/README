This is a short overview of the xpclient code. 

xpclient is a sample client application building on the idea of an 
open source and flexible data exchange framework which communicates 
flight data to/from the X-Plane flight simulator.

This code here and the related X-Plane plugin xpserver can be found on:
https://github.com/retostockli/xpcockpit

The client can subscribe to specific X-Plane datarefs and also create own datarefs,
which can be exchanged via the xpserver X-Plane plugin to other clients. 

The client has the following boundary conditions: 
- All communication occurs via TCP/IP
- a local copy of the dataref memory is maintained by the client. If either 
  the X-plane server disconnects or if X-Plane is not yet connected, the data 
  is fully accessible.
- unless either the client or X-Plane fills the dataref memory, it contains 
  missing values (defined in serverdata.h)
- missing values are not transferred to or from X-Plane
- datarefs are subscribed by link_dataref_datatype() and unsubscribed by unlink_dataref()
- upon exit all linked datarefs are unsubscribed automatically
- the first client which subscribes to a custom dataref, creates the dataref 
  memory in X-Plane, all other clients can then regularly subscribe to this 
  custom dataref, which is writable by default.
- custom datarefs have to start with "xpserver/", else the server reports a unknown
  dataref error.
- subscription to arrays can happen by accessing the whole array (argument index
  in link_dataref() set to -1, or single individual elements (argument 
  index in link_dataref() set to 0..nelements-1).
- only data is transferred which has changed since the last transfer on either
  X-Plane's or the client's side.
- with link_dataref() a precision requirement can be set in steps of 10^precision,
  this allows to restrict transfer of data only when it changes by 10^precision.
  So, setting precision to -1 for EGT means that EGT data is only transferred again
  if it changes by 0.1 Degrees C. This makes sense since small changes in many
  datarefs occur which are irrelevant to client applications and would just 
  increase the data tranfer amount by a large factor.
- the data exchange protocol is given in the xpserver plugin README file

INSTALLATION
============

The installation only works on Mac OSX and Linux. 
Windows is not supported. You need a working C compiler and GNU make.

If you have a fresh git clone, then please first do these in order
to set up all automake/autoconf files
autoreconf
automake --add-missing
autoreconf

Then type:
./configure
make

Optionally type:
make install

RUNNING
=======

cd src/
./xpclient

You should see (there are three X-Plane datarefs (Latitude and EGT for Engine
1 and 2, plus a custom dataref CUSTOM. Latitude and EGT's are only displayed
once X-Plane sends data, CUSTOM simply increases and is transferred to X-Plane
and eventually to another client):
