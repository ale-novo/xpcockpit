Short Introduction for Windows Users
------------------------------------



xpcockpit-windows.zip is the windows build for the open source xpopengc OpenGC-based 
Glass Cockpit and the xpserver plugin for x-plane. It is made for those
who want to try out our software on Windows without installing a full
development platform. However, if you want to change, extend or add new
gauges to xpopengc, it is needed to do basic programming in C++ and
you will need to get familiar with the minGW programming environment
through MSYS2 on Windows.

I. How to try with the precompiled xpserver - xpopengc version for testing
==========================================================================

How-to install:
1. Go to xpserver/plugins/. Copy the xpserver subdirectory there into the X-Plane 
   plugins directory. The plugin does handle data I/O between X-Plane and
   connected clients. The plugin does not require any configuration. It 
   is built for the 64 bit version of X-Plane and runs on X-Plane 10 and 11.
   The plugin has very low overhead in X-Plane since 
   - only data is transferred for which clients subscribe to 
   - data are transferred in its native format, 
   - floating point data is only transferred when it changes with a user defined threshold
   - clients can unsubscribe to data when they don't need it any more
   - individual elements of array data can be transferred

2. Start X-Plane. Check out for the appearance of xpserver.log in X-Plane's
   root folder. If it does not appear, please check Log.txt in X-Plane's
   root folder. It should have a successful plugin loading message like:

Loaded: /home/stockli/X-Plane 11/Resources/plugins/xpserver/64/win.xpl (xplanesd
k.xpserver).

3. Go to xpopengc/share/xpopengc/ and take the boeing737pfd.ini as a test gauge.
   Edit the XPlanePath directory. xpopengc needs to know that in order to read
   the navigation data from X-Plane. You can set CustomData to 1 if you have
   your own navigation data (e.g. from Navigraph) inside "Custom Data" of X-Plane.
   If you're running xpopengc on a different computer than X-Plane, please
   set the Server IP address of the X-Plane computer.

4. Go to xpopengc/bin in a terminal or the windows power shell and type
   xpopengc.exe boeing737pfd

   This should get you a single gauge on the screen with the PFD Display
   of a Boeing 737. It will work with the ZIBO MOD, x737 or any X-Plane 
   aircraft (the latter with less things displayed).


You can now start to test other gauges, move them around on the screen
and modify their size. You can also use many gauges on one single call.

Have fun. 

II. How to compile from source and develop your own xpcockpit stuff on Windows
==============================================================================

The real way to work with this is to write your own
gauges. Install MSYS2 on Windows with the full gnu development tools and
start crafting:

https://www.msys2.org

Start the MSYS2 command line with the UCRT environment and install the following packages:
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc
pacman -S git

git clone git@github.com:retostockli/xpcockpit
