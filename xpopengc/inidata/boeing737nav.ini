# This is a sample initialization file (Boeing-737 style)
# It will probably _NOT_ work on your system without changing paths


#--------BASE INITIALIZATION--------
# These attributes must always be present, and valid
# The X-Plane path is needed in order to read the navigation
# database and thus access exactly the same navigation data
# as used in X-Plane itself.

#--------RENDER WINDOW SETUP--------
