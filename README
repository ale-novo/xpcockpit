This is the xpcockpit Project by Reto Stockli, supported by Hans Jansen
.
It enables to connect custom hardware to X-Plane by use of a C library
which allows to subscribe to X-Plane datarefs and commands. The
currently supported hardware is most OpenCockpits cards and Leo Bodnar's 
BU0836 card. The project also includes a glass cockpit software which
is a further development of the OpenGC project for Boeing 737 and Airbus 320.

The project consists of four components
xpserver: the plugin to X-Plane which handles dataref/command I/O via TCP/IP
xpclient: a sample client software to show how to subscribe and use datarefs
xpusb: the actual client which interacts with OpenCockpits/Leo Bodnar's Hardware
xpopengc: the glass cockpit software client that simulates B737/A320 Gauges

The project is aimed at the following crowd:
- X-Plane users working on Linux or OSX and now also on Windows
- People who want to build their own home cockpits
- People with some programming exercise
- Friends of good wine and cheese

HOW TO START:
- first compile and install the library libxpopencockpits
- then compile and install ther x-plane plugin xpserver
- then compile (and optionally install) any of the clients

Information on compiling and installing those items are found in the respective subdirectories

NEW: for existing users of xpcockpit: the library is a new thing. I've realized that a lot of
the data handling code was replicated in each client, so I've packed everything in a library,
which has to be compiled only once. The clients then all link to this library.
